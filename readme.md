# Chess Engine

- The Chess Engine is a project that aims to create a fully functional chess engine in [programming language]. It's designed to provide a platform for playing chess against the computer and exploring various aspects of chess programming.

## Features

- **Board Representation:** The engine uses an efficient board representation to manage the game state and legal moves.
- **Move Generation:** It implements a move generation algorithm to calculate all legal moves for a given position.
- **Search Algorithm:** The engine uses a search algorithm (e.g., Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning) to find the best move in a given position.
- **FEN Support:** The engine supports Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) strings for specifying board positions.
- **User Interface:** Provides a simple command-line interface to play against the computer.
- **AI Difficulty Levels:** Different difficulty levels allow players of various skill levels to enjoy the game.
- **Board Visualization:** Displays the current board position during the game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiteshchawla1511/chess-engine.git
   ```

## FEN Support
- The Chess Engine also supports FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings, a standard notation for describing chess positions. To use FEN strings, simply input a valid FEN string when prompted, and the engine will set up the board accordingly.
